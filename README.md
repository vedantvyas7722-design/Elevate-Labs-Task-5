# **Task 5: Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis (Summary)**

### **Objective**

The goal was to capture live network traffic, use display filters to isolate specific protocols, and analyze their function to gain a practical understanding of network communication.

### **Process Overview**

A live packet capture was initiated on a Kali Linux machine. To generate traffic, I browsed several websites and used the ping command. The resulting capture was then analyzed in Wireshark, where display filters were applied to investigate individual protocols.

### **Key Protocols Identified**

The analysis successfully isolated and examined the roles of four fundamental protocols:

* **DNS** (Domain Name System)  
* **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)  
* **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)  
* **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol)

### **Deliverables**

* **Full Packet Capture:** The complete .pcapng file is available in this repository:

* **Detailed Report:** For a comprehensive breakdown of the findings, including packet-level details, screenshots, and answers to the interview questions, please see the full report:
